    abstract = "{Visualization in three-dimensional (3D) space is a standard but critical process for examining the complex structure of high dimensional data. Stereoscopic imaging technology can be adopted to enhance 3D representation of many complex data, especially those consisting of points and lines. We illustrate the simple steps that are involved and strongly recommend others to implement it in designing visualization software. To facilitate its application, we created a new software that can convert a regular 3D scatterplot or network figure to a pair of stereo images.Stereo3D is freely available as an open source R package released under an MIT license at https://github.com/bioinfoDZ/Stereo3D. Others can integrate the codes and implement the method in academic software.The description of R package and supplemental figures are provided at Bioinformatics online.}",
